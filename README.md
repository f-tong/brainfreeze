Brain Freeze is a Java Swing study app featuring three active recall techniques: flashcards, blurting, and line memorization.
Each section's class holds its unique functionality, with basic navigation and styling inherited from the Window class.
Navigation is primarily handled with the Buttons classes.

To try it out, download the zip file, extract, and run in VS Code or another code editor of choice.
